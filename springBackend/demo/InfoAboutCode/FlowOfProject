The flow of the Spring Boot Project:

1. **Client Request**
   - The client (browser, Postman, etc.) sends an HTTP request to the server.

2. **Controller Layer**
   - The request is received by a REST Controller.
   - The controller maps the request to a specific handler method using annotations like @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.

3. **Service Layer**
   - The controller calls the appropriate service class.
   - The service layer contains business logic and processes the request.

4. **Repository Layer**
   - The service interacts with the repository (DAO) layer.
   - The repository uses Spring Data JPA to perform CRUD operations on the database.

5. **Database**
   - The repository executes queries and interacts with the database (e.g., MySQL, H2).

6. **Response Flow**
   - The data retrieved or processed is returned from the repository to the service.
   - The service returns the result to the controller.
   - The controller sends the response back to the client in JSON or XML format.

7. **Exception Handling**
   - If any error occurs, it is handled by @ControllerAdvice or exception handler methods.

8. **Logging & Security**
   - Logging is performed at various layers for monitoring.
   - Security (if implemented) checks requests using Spring Security.

**Summary:**
Client → Controller → Service → Repository → Database  
Database → Repository → Service → Controller → Client
